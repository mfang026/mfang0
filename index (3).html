        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi, Iâ€™m Ming Han Fang, and Iâ€™m currently studying Business Economics at the University of California, Riverside. Iâ€™m passionate about understanding how businesses operate and the factors that influence economies. Throughout my time at UCR, Iâ€™ve focused on building a strong academic foundation in economics and business, consistently earning good grades and gaining a deep understanding of key economic principles. Iâ€™m excited to apply this knowledge in a professional setting where I can contribute to decision-making processes and business growth.

Alongside my studies, I have had the opportunity to work as a Student Assistant at the International Student Center on campus. In this role, I assisted international students with a variety of needs, including paperwork, orientation programs, and organizing events and workshops. This experience has taught me how to communicate effectively, manage multiple tasks, and work with a diverse group of individuals. Itâ€™s also given me a valuable perspective on cultural diversity, and Iâ€™ve learned how to provide thoughtful support to students from all over the world. Working in this dynamic environment has helped me build strong interpersonal and organizational skills that I believe will be beneficial as I enter the professional world.

In addition to my academic achievements and work experience, I am also an avid basketball player. Playing basketball has been an important part of my life for many years. Through the sport, Iâ€™ve learned essential life skills like leadership, teamwork, and discipline. Basketball has taught me the importance of working towards a shared goal and maintaining focus, both of which are qualities I bring to my studies and work. Whether on the court or in the classroom, I strive to stay committed and focused on achieving my goals, and I enjoy collaborating with others to tackle challenges.

Outside of academics and basketball, Iâ€™m also a big fan of video games. I enjoy playing in my free time because it helps me unwind and relax, and it also teaches me strategic thinking, quick decision-making, and teamwork in multiplayer games. While itâ€™s a fun hobby, Iâ€™ve also noticed how gaming helps me develop skills that are transferable to real-world situations, such as problem-solving and the ability to think critically under pressure.

I am particularly interested in pursuing a career in [mention your specific interest, like finance, marketing, consulting, etc.]. I believe that the combination of my academic background, my on-campus work experience, and my passion for continuous learning will allow me to thrive in a professional setting. Iâ€™m looking for opportunities where I can use my skills in communication, teamwork, and problem-solving to contribute to a team and grow professionally.

When Iâ€™m not studying, playing basketball, or gaming, I enjoy [mention other hobbies or personal interests, like reading, traveling, or volunteering]. I believe in maintaining a balanced lifestyle, which helps me stay motivated and energized.

As I look ahead, Iâ€™m excited about the future and the chance to gain hands-on experience in the business world. Iâ€™m eager to take on new challenges, work with a talented team, and continue growing both personally and professionally.<br><br>
